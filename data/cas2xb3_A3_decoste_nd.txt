On 01/04/2016 I confirm this is my individual work being submitted.
You can use the Class Assignment2.java in order to run the BFS, DFS and Shortest Path and get the outputs. All other classes are individual ADTs. Also note, all
paths are that of Boston -> Miami (in order to show the differences in the Paths in the output file).
Changes:
Changes some of the cities in the dataset if they were inconsistent. Also had to change the latitudes for the restaurants since they were all negative and didnt 
correspond to the positive latitudes in the zips of the city. (Changed it within the program using Math.abs(), not in the dataset). Also I used online help to 
code the Haversine formula for calculating distance using the Longitude and Latitude. I did not copy anything completely just used reference, however it isn't 
that commented since I have limited knowledge about why we apply certain math functions to get to the answer.
